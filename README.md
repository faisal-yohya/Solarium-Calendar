# 🌌 Solarium Calendar

**A 33-Year Cosmic Lunisolar Calendar**

The **Solarium Calendar** is a conceptual timekeeping system that aligns **lunar months** with **solar seasons** over a repeating **33-year cycle**. By distributing **13 intercalary months**, the calendar naturally corrects the drift between lunar and solar years.

**33 solar years ≈ 408 lunar months ≈ 12,045 days**
