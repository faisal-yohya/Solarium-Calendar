# Solarium Calendar

Year: 2026

The Solarium Calendar is an original 33-year arithmetic luni-solar calendar system. 
It introduces a structured cycle of 409 months, including 13 intercalary months, 
with a fixed leap-year pattern and color-coded seasonal framework.
## Abstract
The Solarium Calendar provides a symbolic and practical framework for tracking lunar-solar convergence over a human generational span (33 years). 
It aligns lunar months with solar years using the concept of Cosmic Years, Common Years, and the intercalary Solarium month.

- Cycle Duration: 33 Years
- Months per Cycle: 409 (12 months common, 13 intercalary)
- Leap Year Pattern: Years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 16, 19, 21, 24, 27, 30, 32, 33
- Month Names & Color Codes:
  | Month | Name     | Season          | Color      |

## Authorship & Originality
This repository represents the original proposal of the Solarium Calendar by Faisal Yohya (2026). 
While astronomical constants are standard, the calendar's structure, naming, and intercalation system are original.
